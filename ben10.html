    </div <h1 style="text-align: center; ">BEN 10</h1>
    <p class="x ">Ben 10 is an<strong> American franchise and television series</strong> created by <strong>Man of Action Studios</strong> and produced by Cartoon Network Studios. The franchise revolves around a boy named
        <span style="font-weight: bold;color: red; ">Ben Tennyson </span>who acquires a watch-style alien device,<span style="color: blue;font-style: italic;font-weight: bolder; ">the Omnitrix which contains DNA of different Alien species allows him to transform into ten aliens and more</span>.
        The Ben 10 franchise has received widespread critical acclaim, winning three Emmy Awards. The franchise consists primarily of five television series and four films, the latter of which aired between August 2007 and March 2012. Spanning fourteen
        years, it is Cartoon Network 's longest-running franchise to date. There is also a Ben 10 toy line manufactured by Bandai for the first 4 shows and Playmates Toys for the reboot. Worldwide, the franchise has grossed over $6 billion in retail sales.

    <h1 class="c " style="text-align: center; ">THE OMINITRIX</h1>
    <p class="c ">
        The Omnitrix, its Ultimatrix replacement, and the "finalized " version that is the New Omnitrix are the central elements of the Ben 10 story. They are all wristwatch-styled devices developed by the Galvan inventor Azmuth that transforms the user into
        any one of many alien beings (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the
        universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct. The Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (Ben 10 and Ben 10: Alien Force), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix
        in the Ultimate Alien series. The Ultimatrix had most of the same functionality as the Omnitrix, but would allow the user to transform the alien into its Ultimate Form (how the species and its DNA would evolve in a one-million-year simulation).
        In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix â€“ the original version has been a prototype. In Ben 10: Omniverse, the Nemetrix, a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced.
        Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are
        unable to use it without incurring mental damage.

    <h1 class="c " style="text-align: center; "></h1>
    <p class="c ">In Omniverse, <strong>ALBEDO</strong> recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms
        of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms. In the Reboot series, Ben's Omnitrix can augment enhancements onto his aliens. In Season 2, his aliens can become "Omni-Enhanced " with rock-like constructs and energy. However, the
        enhancements seems to happen at random. This energy is later revealed to be coming from a new alien species in his Omnitrix, which eventually gets its own form, "Shock Rock ". In Season 4, Ben unlocks the "Omni-Kix " feature, which allows him
        to add armor plating onto his aliens. <strong>The Reboot series also introduces the Antitrix, which is wielded by Kevin Levin</strong>. The Antitrix allows Kevin to transform into 11 aliens, most of which are ones that Ben has used before, but
        significantly altered from Ben 's version.
